%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Along with the rapid development of data volumes, the need for machine-readable data is inevitable. As a result, the use of knowledge graph data structures becomes more popular. With its development, quality aspects of a knowledge graph need to be considered, one of which is knowledge wealth: the amount of information contained in a knowledge graph. A high level of knowledge wealth in a knowledge graph may indicate the high quality of a knowledge graph; conversely, a low level of knowledge wealth can be a sign of poor quality of a knowledge graph. However, there is no formal way to define knowledge wealth and how to measure and analyze it. This study proposes a framework to analyze knowledge wealth and the level of knowledge imbalance in the RDF knowledge graph by seeing how the knowledge wealth of an entity class is spread over the knowledge graph using statistical measures and visualization. In addition, this framework also helps to identify entity groups based on the level of wealth in their class, finds the best theoretical distribution that fits best to knowledge wealth distribution, performs clustering on classes based on the shape of knowledge wealth distribution, and detects bias in a knowledge graph. To evaluate this framework, some use cases were conducted on several classes on Wikidata. It is hoped that the results of this study can assist in researching knowledge wealth in the knowledge graph and be used to optimize the efforts of editing and developing knowledge graph projects by the contributors.
