% \subsection{Bias in Wikidata}
\subsection{Group-Level Gap in Representation in Wikidata}

In this subsection, analysis is conducted to see whether any particular entity group in Wikidata is underrepresented compared to others. There are 2 analysis done: gender-based gap and regional gap.

For this analysis, we use $W_{bag,*,[out]}$ as the definition of wealth, i.e., the notion of bag of properties, including all property types, and assuming outgoing link direction. This choice is motivated by the need to capture the total volume of information associated with each entity, regardless of teh type of property. Moroever, using outgoing links ensures we measure the knowledge attached to an entity, which is more suitable for identifying disparities in how richly different groups are described in Wikidata.
