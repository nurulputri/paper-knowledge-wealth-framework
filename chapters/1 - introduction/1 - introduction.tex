Our study proposes a formal model of knowledge wealth in the RDF knowledge graph by seeing how the knowledge wealth of an entity class is spread over the knowledge graph using statistical measures and visualization. In addition, a comprehensive analytical framework is also contructed that would give insights about the wealth of a class, the inequality between classes, and similarity of class distributions. To evaluate this framework, some use cases were conducted on \textbf{several <here change to exact number>} classes on Wikidata.
