\section{Knowledge Wealth Framework}

% - RDF model, triples
% - definition of wealth berdasarkan property (kardinalitas, tipe properti, arah properti)
% - insight model

In this section, we define the formal framework for measuring knowledge wealth in knowledge graphs (KGs). We start by introducing the underlying data model based on RDF structure and how entities are represented through triples. Then, we formalize different notions of knowledge wealth using property-based metrics. Lastly, we present an insight model that supports both quantitative analysis and qualitative interpretation of wealth distributions across entity classes.
