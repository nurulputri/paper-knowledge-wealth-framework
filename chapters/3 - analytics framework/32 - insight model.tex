\textit{(Here, should we mention about EDA and simple measures we use in this study? i.e., mean, median mode, etc)}

\paragraph{Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive Statistics Measures.} Descriptive statistics is concerned with the description and summarization of data. It is a summary of a dataset that helps to describe features of data quantitatively (Ross, 2019). To have a general view of wealth distribution of a class, we use the following measures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
  \item measures of frequency: count, cumulative frequency/percentage
  \item measures of position: quartile, percentile
  \item measures of dispersion: minimum, maximum, range, interquartile range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis
  \item measures of symmetry: skewness
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Gini Coefficient}

\paragraph{Lorenz Curve} Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of wealth inequality (The Lorenz Curve: What It Tells You About Economic Inequality, 2022). It shows how the wealth is cumulatively distributed, with data points sorted from the poorest to the richest. \textit{(Here, give the example of Lorenz Curve)}.
