The increasing volume of data has amplified the demand for structured, machine-readable information, making knowledge graphs essential for organizing and storing knowledge. One key aspect of knowledge graph quality is knowledge wealth, which represents the amount of information an entity possess. A higher knowledge wealth suggests a more informative and robust knowledge graph, whereas a low wealth level indicates gaps and potential biases. However, there is no standardized method to quantify and analyze knowledge wealth. This study introduces a framework to measure knowledge wealth and assess knowledge imbalance within knowledge graphs, and focusing on Wikidata as a case study. The proposed approach employs statistical measures and visualizations to analyze the distribution of knowledge wealth across entity classes. Through various use cases, the study demonstrates how disparities in knowledge representation impact balance in data. The framework also examines how different definitions of knowledge wealth influence inequality measurements, such as the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves. The findings provide valuable insights for knowledge graph contributors, assisting in optimizing the efforts of editathon and developing knowledge graph projects by the contributors and reducing information imbalances.
