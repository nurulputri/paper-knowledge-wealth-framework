The increasing volume of data has amplified the demand for structured, machine-readable information, making knowledge graphs essential for organizing and storing knowledge. Understanding and ensuring the quality of knowledge graphs are essential to improving their fairness and usability. One key aspect of knowledge graph quality is knowledge wealth, which represents the amount of information contained in the graph.
At the entity level, wealth indicates how much information is associated with that entity. When aggregated across entities, it reflects the overall informativeness of the knowledge graph. A higher level of knowledge wealth across the graph suggests a more informative and robust resource, whereas a low wealth level points to limited information availability.
% A higher level of knowledge wealth suggests a more informative and robust knowledge graph, whereas a low wealth level indicates gaps and potential biases.
However, there is no standardized method to quantify and analyze knowledge wealth. This study introduces a novel framework for quantifying knowledge wealth and assessing knowledge gap within knowledge graphs, and focuses on Wikidata as a case study. The proposed approach formalizes three notions of knowledge wealth, and their combinations, based on property cardinality, property type, and link direction, and employs statistical measures and visualizations such as the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves, to analyze the distribution of knowledge wealth. We also develop a Python-based implementation that supports analysis facilitates and insight discovery. Through empirical evaluation, we reveal significant knowledge gaps across gender (male vs. female entities) and geographic regions (western vs. non-western entities). We also examine how different definitions of knowledge wealth influence inequality measurements. Another key finding is the structural gap across property types, where certain properties (e.g., object, literal, ID) contribute disproportionately to entity wealth, leading to systemic imbalances. Our findings provide valuable insights into identifying underrepresented entities and support data enrichment efforts aimed at closing knowledge gaps in open KGs.
% Through various use cases, the study demonstrates how disparities in knowledge representation impact balance in data. The framework also examines how different definitions of knowledge wealth influence inequality measurements, such as the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves. The findings provide valuable insights for knowledge graph contributors, assisting in optimizing the efforts of editathon and developing knowledge graph projects by the contributors and reducing information imbalances.
